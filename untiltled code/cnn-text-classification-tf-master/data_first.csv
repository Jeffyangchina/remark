1,in less than months we achieved stability and a chemical free operation in our effluent treatment plant weve saved money on energy and chemical costs and no longer generate waste sludge biowish is phenomenal george paul director synthite industries india we had a recent case of very strong odour from a deceased body in a house and had tried the top deodorising product from one of australias leading cleaning products companies which hardly made a difference we then used just gm of biowish odor and applied it with our low volume high pressure misting equipment and obtained at least a reduction in odour the result was nothing short of amazing and allowed the house to return to rental stock we strongly recommend the product for very intense odours shane aylmore carnarvon pest control australia i am a client of biowish technologies pty ltd and have used their product in the waste industry we current operate a landfill facility which has potential for odour problems we specifically applied biowish odor to a wet weather area in which odour was a problem we applied the product as a surface spray and were more then satisfied with the elimination of odour second to that the product was easy to handle and prepare for application with no health and safety issues this was the first use of a biowish product and we feel comfortable with the product to continue doing business we also would recommend its use in similar applications james fox environmental officer brisbane city council australia we noticed that the treated plants grew more consistently and are more healthy and vibrant than we have seen them before the increase in yield weight was also noticeable when we harvested the bok choy as was the improved palatability we have continued to use the product beyond the trial and would recommend it to other hydroponic farming operations adam and damien manno owners manno hydroponics australia biowish will revolutionize the hydroponics industry by helping farmers to harvest more regularly ive been in the hydroponics business for years and havent seen anything like it before we introduced the technology in one of our worst performing greenhouses to really test it out but within weeks it became one of our best in terms of plant performance and health not only were the lettuces heavier they were also thicker and more consistent joe danastasi owner glenorie hydroponics australia i had used biowish on a blocked trade waste drain in a restaurant those in the industry will know that grease trap odour can be the worst of all and in a restaurant it will certainly put diners off their food after clearing the blockage and cleaning up i told the restaurant owner that i was going to use a new product that would eliminate odour from his restaurant and the grease trap initially he was skeptical as i was at first however after using biowish the smell had completely disappeared and he was able to use his kitchen and the restaurant that same afternoon needless to say my client was very glad that i had used biowish brad major sydney drain clearing and plumbing australia we used biowish over the past months we empty the contents down the dish washer sink and have achieved extraordinary results previously our grease tank had to be cleaned out by a private contractor four times a year now there is no need as biowish breaks down the grease and self manages the grease tank we have been most impressed with this product and will recommend it to our colleagues in the catering industry dick boyle managing director the grand hotel united kingdom i have used biowish on a sewer that had overflowed into the backyard of a terrace house in sydney after mixing the product with water i simply poured it over the affected area and within seconds the smell was completely gone this was the first time i had used the product and i have to say i was amazed brad major sydney drain clearing plumbing australia you can tell biowish is working to break down the sludge and organic waste we have never seen activity like this in our dams before david mcleod manager david mcleod manager boen boe stud australia australia since adding

system frode aarsby general manager star autoco as norway kemp meats pty ltd has been trialling and using biowish in effluent ponds to control odor and solids we are very happy with the results and would recommend biowish to other meat processing plants to control odor we are extremely impressed by the very high level of service something rare in this present economic climate andrew kemp kemp meats pty ltd australia six weeks after applying biowish to our effluent ponds the sludge buildup has been noticeably reduced our wash down water is much cleaner and has no smell michael sams manager

leon plant manager foster farms manufacturing facility usa the great reduction in sludge generated by the plant and the associated costs of removal which were the single largest operating cost item in

technical wind farm design planning and environmental impact assessment bank financing and wind farm construction we take charge of epc thanks to its experience of years in the field of renewables it has the necessary know how to solve the complexity of planning building and operating the hes we consider wind turbines as well as photovoltaic in combinations with modern storage systems its innovative model calculates different options for any given circumstance thus enabling it to design the optimal system for clients needs the detailed yield simulation of the pv plants and or the wind turbines are combined with the analysis of the behavior and specifications of generators and or storage systems and demand forecasts this allows the evaluation of the best financial system design considering the technical feasibility specific variations of parameters according to special local conditions are possible as well grid stability using embedded renewable generation can help to stabilise rural distribution networks and to avoid blackouts in developing countries many developing and newly industrialised countries rely on extremely large electricity distribution networks that operate at the limit of voltage stability as a result the power fed into the grid can suffer huge losses on the way to the consumers in conventional electrical distribution systems centralised generating stations supply power to distributed consumers therefore where the voltage varies this can lead to a reduced electrical output that is much lower than theoretically possible frequent blackouts and an unstable electrical supply are the consequences in a recent project in tanzania abo wind demonstrated that extremely large distribution networks operating at the limit of voltage stability and experiencing substantial distribution constraints can be stabilised using renewables such as photovoltaic plants and energy storage systems using optimally distributed perimeter stations incorporating renewable resources and energy storage the network can be supported and network efficiency can be improved significantly with the help of renewables it is possible to minimise cable losses and to stabilise large networks this is an eco friendly and cost effective option which helps to prevent critical supply situations due to electrical fluctuation not only can this stabilise the existing network but the combination of renewables and storage units can help enlarge it too heat supply abo wind acts as a virtual energy utility by delivering heat and electricity within a long term contract to the end costumer the energy contracting team assumes the responsibility to provide properties with heat and electricity we install combined heat and power plants which is an efficient and eco friendly way to produce energy so far abo wind has implemented projects to supply industrial enterprises office buildings a school and a hotel the new energy contracting model has many advantages

technical wind farm design planning and environmental impact assessment bank financing and wind farm construction we take charge of epc thanks to its experience of years in the field of renewables it has the necessary know how to solve the complexity of planning building and operating the hes we consider wind turbines as well as photovoltaic in combinations with modern storage systems its innovative model calculates different options for any given circumstance thus enabling it to design the optimal system for clients needs the detailed yield simulation of the pv plants and or the wind turbines are combined with the analysis of the behavior and specifications of generators and or storage systems and demand forecasts this allows the evaluation of the best financial system design considering the technical feasibility specific variations of parameters according to special local conditions are possible as well grid stability using embedded renewable generation can help to stabilise rural distribution networks and to avoid blackouts in developing countries many developing and newly industrialised countries rely on extremely large electricity distribution networks that operate at the limit of voltage stability as a result the power fed into the grid can suffer huge losses on the way to the consumers in conventional electrical distribution systems centralised generating stations supply power to distributed consumers therefore where the voltage varies this can lead to a reduced electrical output that is much lower than theoretically possible frequent blackouts and an unstable electrical supply are the consequences in a recent project in tanzania abo wind demonstrated that extremely large distribution networks operating at the limit of voltage stability and experiencing substantial distribution constraints can be stabilised using renewables such as photovoltaic plants and energy storage systems using optimally distributed perimeter stations incorporating renewable resources and energy storage the network can be supported and network efficiency can be improved significantly with the help of renewables it is possible to minimise cable losses and to stabilise large networks this is an eco friendly and cost effective option which helps to prevent critical supply situations due to electrical fluctuation not only can this stabilise the existing network but the combination of renewables and storage units can help enlarge it too heat supply abo wind acts as a virtual energy utility by delivering heat and electricity within a long term contract to the end costumer the energy contracting team assumes the responsibility to provide properties with heat and electricity we install combined heat and power plants which is an efficient and

government owned bank kfw international investors as well as local or regional utilities are among the investors who buy its wind farms after construction wind project development epc the abo wind team consists of about professionals with expertise covering all phases of wind farm development and epc from site selection and land acquisition to assessing the specific wind yield for a project technical wind farm design planning and environmental impact assessment bank financing and wind farm construction we take charge of epc thanks to its experience of years in the field of renewables it has the necessary know how to solve the complexity of planning building and operating the hes we consider wind turbines as well as photovoltaic in combinations with modern storage systems its innovative model calculates different options for any given circumstance thus enabling it to design the optimal system for clients needs the detailed yield simulation of the pv plants and or the wind turbines are combined with the analysis of the behavior and specifications of generators and or storage systems and demand forecasts this allows the evaluation of the best financial system design considering the technical feasibility specific variations of parameters according to special local conditions are possible as well grid stability using embedded renewable generation can help to stabilise rural distribution networks and to avoid blackouts in developing countries many developing and newly industrialised countries rely on extremely large electricity distribution networks that operate at the limit of voltage stability as a result the power fed into the grid can suffer huge losses on the way to the consumers in conventional electrical distribution systems centralised generating stations supply power to distributed consumers therefore where the voltage varies this can lead to a reduced electrical output that is much lower than theoretically possible frequent blackouts and an unstable electrical supply are the consequences in a recent project in tanzania abo wind demonstrated that extremely large distribution networks operating at the limit of voltage stability and experiencing substantial distribution constraints can be stabilised using renewables such as photovoltaic plants and energy storage systems using optimally distributed perimeter stations incorporating renewable resources and energy storage the network can be supported and network efficiency can be improved significantly with the help of renewables it is possible to minimise cable losses and to stabilise large networks this is an eco friendly and cost effective option which helps to prevent critical supply situations due to electrical fluctuation not only can this stabilise the existing network but the combination of renewables and storage units can help enlarge it too heat supply abo wind acts as a virtual energy utility by delivering heat and electricity within a long term contract to the end costumer the energy contracting team assumes the responsibility to provide properties with heat and electricity we install combined heat and power plants which is an efficient and eco friendly way to produce energy so far abo wind has implemented projects to supply industrial enterprises office buildings a school and a hotel the new energy contracting model has many advantages abo wind adds a combined heat and power plant to the heating unit of large buildings bears all the necessary investment costs takes care of the operation and maintenance of the heating unit supplies the tenants with affordable heat and electricity straight from the building s boiler room and takes care of the billing this way the owners improve the carbon footprint of their building increase the value of its premises with a more efficient heating unit spare themselves the work of maintenance and billing and don t need to invest anything owners and tenants benefit from a reliable energy supply

farmers to harvest more regularly ive been in the hydroponics business for years and havent seen anything like it before we introduced the technology in one of our worst performing greenhouses to

glenorie hydroponics australia i had used biowish on a blocked trade waste drain in a restaurant those in the industry will know that grease trap odour can be the worst of all and in a restaurant it will certainly put diners off their food after clearing the blockage and cleaning up i told the restaurant owner that i was going to use a new product that would eliminate odour from his restaurant and the grease trap initially he was skeptical as i was at first however after using biowish the smell had completely disappeared and he was able to use his kitchen and the restaurant that same afternoon needless to say my client was very glad that i had used biowish brad major sydney drain clearing and plumbing australia we used biowish over the past months we empty the contents down the dish washer sink and have achieved extraordinary results previously our grease tank had to be cleaned out by a private contractor four times a year now there is no need as biowish breaks down the
